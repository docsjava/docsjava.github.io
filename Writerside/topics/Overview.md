# Overview

Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It has evolved from
humble beginnings to power a large share of today’s digital world, by providing the reliable platform upon which many
services and applications are built. New, innovative products and digital services designed for the future continue to
rely on Java, as well.

While most modern Java applications combine the Java runtime and application together, there are still many applications
and even some websites that will not function unless you have a desktop Java installed. The
website [java.com](https://java.com),
is intended for consumers who may still require Java for their desktop applications – specifically applications
targeting
Java 8. Developers as well as users that would like to learn Java programming should visit
the [dev.java](https://dev.java) website instead
and business users should visit [oracle.com/java](https://oracle.com/java) for more information.
